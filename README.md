simple personal Resume / blogging site
built as a way to learn and play around with hugo
and themed with a [fork](https://github.com/crawdaddie/hugo-researcher) of [hugo-researcher](https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher)

[CI via github actions](.github/workflows/main.yml) builds the site and uploads it to a static-hosting s3 bucket
