Backend engineer with 6 years of experience passionate about experimentation and clean solutions.  
I work closely with product stakeholders to ensure alignment with user needs, and try to learn as much as possible from every member of a team I interact with.  
In my most recent roles I have focused on optimising my backend work for consistency, fault-tolerance and observability, while pushing for high technical standards from myself and colleagues.  
I am most interested in roles where I can build on my technical leadership, and work on distributed, data-intensive cloud-native systems.
