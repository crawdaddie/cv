{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}
Backend engineer with 6 years of experience passionate about experimentation and clean solutions.  
I work closely with product stakeholders to ensure alignment with user needs, and try to learn as much as possible from every member of a team I interact with.  
In my most recent roles I have focused on optimising my backend work for consistency and fault-tolerance, while pushing for high technical standards from myself and colleagues.  
I am most interested in roles where I can build on my technical leadership, and work on distributed, data-intensive systems.

## Experience
### Curation Corporation - Senior backend developer
London - 6/2021 - present  
- Development of internal tools consisting of a user-facing platform supporting ESG experts in synthesising smart insights and business intelligence from a wide variety of news sources
- {{<kwt "typescript nodejs kubernetes docker graphql">}}designed and implemented backend services for creating automated email briefings which helped reduce the time taken to create briefings by 84% compared to previous non-integrated workflows, and assisted with the creation of UIs for these tools{{</kwt>}}
- {{<kwt "kubernetes elasticsearch nodejs">}}maintenance and tuning of data pipelines which process up to 300,000 articles a day and push them to different search indices{{</kwt>}}
- {{<kwt "python fastapi">}}productionisation and deployment of NLP models as FastAPI services for purposes of abstractive text-summarisation and entity extraction{{</kwt>}}   
  in the case of abstractive text-summarisation performed on GPUs, I also managed securing the extra-cluster deployments from traffic outside our network and linking them to the rest of our infrastructure over a VPN.  
  this reduced the time taken to generate an abstract by 90% compared to a CPU-based deployment
- implemented several DX improvements to our backend codebase:
  - {{<kwt "typescript graphql">}}championed use of typescript and increased modularity with some instances of dependency injection{{</kwt>}}
  - increased test-coverage and added backend test-suites to CI pipelines
  - database migrations
  - {{<kwt "kubernetes docker mssql">}}utilities for repeatable fully-seeded test deployments{{</kwt>}}
